# AI Tools Integration

The gx402 SDK integrates seamlessly with popular AI development tools to enhance your development workflow and productivity.

## Overview

AI tools can significantly accelerate your development process when working with gx402 SDK. This guide covers integration with the most popular tools.

## Cursor Integration

Cursor is a powerful AI-powered code editor that can help you develop with the gx402 SDK more efficiently.

### Setup for gx402 Development

1. Install Cursor from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Open your project directory in Cursor
3. Install the gx402 extension or ensure proper language support

### AI-Powered Features with gx402

#### Code Completion
Cursor can suggest gx402 SDK methods and parameters:

```javascript
// Just start typing "gx402." and Cursor will suggest:
gx402.processX402Data(data, options)
// or
gx402.authenticate(userId, token)
// or
gx402.sync(key, data)
```

#### Context-Aware Suggestions
When working with gx402 functionality, Cursor understands:
- Available methods and parameters
- Proper initialization patterns
- Error handling best practices
- Platform-specific implementations

#### Code Generation
Ask Cursor to generate common gx402 patterns:

> "Generate a player state sync function using gx402 SDK"

```javascript
const syncPlayerState = async (gx402, playerId, state) => {
  try {
    await gx402.sync('player-state', {
      playerId,
      state,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
    console.log(`Player ${playerId} state synced`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sync failed:', error);
  }
};
```

### Best Practices with Cursor

1. **Explain your intent clearly** when asking for code generation
2. **Reference your platform** (Unity, Unreal, WebGL, etc.) for accurate suggestions
3. **Ask for security considerations** to ensure best practices
4. **Request error handling** patterns specific to your use case

## Claude Code Integration

Claude Code (Anthropic) can help with more complex gx402 SDK implementations.

### Setup

1. Use Claude in your preferred interface (web, desktop, or IDE plugin)
2. Ensure Claude has access to your codebase if needed

### Advanced Use Cases

#### Architecture Planning
Ask Claude to help plan complex gx402 implementations:

> "How should I structure real-time multiplayer sync for a Unity game using gx402 SDK?"

#### Problem Solving
Get help with specific challenges:

> "My sync is failing with 'NETWORK_ERROR' - what are common causes?"

#### Code Review
Have Claude review your gx402 implementations:

> "Review this gx402 authentication code for security issues"

#### Migration Assistance
> "Help me migrate from direct API calls to gx402 SDK in my existing codebase"

### Claude-Specific Tips for gx402

1. **Provide context** about your platform and use case
2. **Share relevant code snippets** for targeted advice
3. **Ask for multiple approaches** to solve complex problems
4. **Request security and performance considerations**

## Windsurf Integration

Windsurf Studio includes AI features that can enhance gx402 development.

### AI Features that Help with gx402

#### Code Suggestions
Windsurf can suggest appropriate gx402 methods based on context:
- Initialization patterns
- Error handling structures  
- Sync strategies
- Authentication flows

#### Documentation Generation
Generate documentation for your gx402 implementations:
- JSDoc comments for functions
- README sections for gx402 features
- API documentation for custom wrappers

#### Testing Assistance
Generate tests for your gx402 integrations:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for sync operations
- Mock implementations for testing

### Optimizing Windsurf for gx402 Development

1. **Keep related files open** to provide context for AI suggestions
2. **Use clear function names** that reflect gx402 functionality
3. **Maintain consistent code style** for better AI understanding
4. **Ask for platform-specific recommendations**

## General AI Development Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering for gx402

#### Good Prompts
```
"Write a Unity C# function that initializes gx402 SDK with error handling"
```

#### Better Prompts  
```
"I'm building a Unity game and need to initialize the gx402 SDK on app start. 
Include proper error handling, debug logging for development, and follow Unity best practices. 
The API key should be configurable through a scriptable object."
```

### Security Considerations

When using AI tools with gx402:

1. **Never share API keys** in prompts
2. **Verify generated security code** before implementation
3. **Ensure proper authentication patterns** are used
4. **Double-check encryption configurations**

### Code Verification

Always verify AI-generated gx402 code:

1. **Test functionality** thoroughly
2. **Check for proper error handling**
3. **Verify security configurations**
4. **Ensure performance considerations** are met
5. **Confirm platform-specific requirements**

## Example: AI-Assisted Implementation

Here's how you might work with an AI tool to implement a feature:

### Initial Request
> "I need to implement player position sync across platforms using gx402 SDK"

### AI Response
```javascript
// Example implementation
class PlayerSync {
  constructor(gx402) {
    this.gx402 = gx402;
    this.playerId = null;
  }
  
  async initialize(playerId) {
    this.playerId = playerId;
    
    // Subscribe to position updates from other players
    this.gx402.subscribe('player-position', (data) => {
      if (data.playerId !== this.playerId) {
        this.updateRemotePlayer(data);
      }
    });
  }
  
  async syncPosition(x, y) {
    await this.gx402.sync('player-position', {
      playerId: this.playerId,
      position: { x, y },
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
}
```

### Follow-up Request
> "Add error handling and rate limiting to prevent sync spam"

The AI would then suggest improvements like exponential backoff, retry logic, and rate limiting.

## Maximizing Productivity

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Plan with AI**: Ask for architectural suggestions
2. **Generate boilerplate**: Let AI create basic implementations
3. **Refine manually**: Add your specific game logic
4. **Review with AI**: Check for best practices and issues
5. **Test thoroughly**: Always verify functionality

### Common AI-Assisted Patterns

- **Initialization helpers** for different platforms
- **Error handling wrappers** that follow best practices
- **Sync strategy templates** for different game types
- **Performance optimization** suggestions
- **Security validation** for sensitive operations

AI tools are powerful accelerators for gx402 development, but always combine AI suggestions with your domain knowledge and thorough testing.
