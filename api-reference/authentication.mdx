## API Key Authentication

All API requests to the gx402 SDK require authentication using an API key. This key identifies your application and grants access to the gx402 services.

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the `X-GX402-API-Key` header:

```
X-GX402-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## HMAC Signature Verification for Webhooks

For enhanced security, gx402 webhooks include an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the request header. This allows you to verify the authenticity and integrity of webhook payloads received by your application.

To verify a webhook signature:

1.  Retrieve the `signature` from the `X-GX402-Signature` header of the incoming webhook request.
2.  Reconstruct the signed payload by concatenating the timestamp (from `X-GX402-Timestamp` header) and the raw request body.
3.  Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the reconstructed payload using your webhook secret as the key.
4.  Compare your computed hash with the `signature` received in the header. If they match, the webhook is authentic.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, timestamp, secret) {
  const signedPayload = `${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
                                  .update(signedPayload)
                                  .digest('hex');
  return expectedSignature === signature;
}

// In your webhook handler:
const webhookSecret = process.env.GX402_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
const signature = req.headers['x-gx402-signature'];
const timestamp = req.headers['x-gx402-timestamp'];
const rawBody = req.rawBody; // Get the raw request body

if (verifyWebhookSignature(rawBody, signature, timestamp, webhookSecret)) {
  // Process webhook event
} else {
  // Signature verification failed
  res.status(403).send('Invalid signature');
}
```

**Note:** Always use a secure, randomly generated secret for your webhooks and store it securely. The raw request body is crucial for signature verification; ensure your server framework does not parse the body before verification.
