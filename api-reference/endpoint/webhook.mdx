# Webhook Events

Documentation for webhook events that can be received from the gx402 API.

## Overview

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about events in the gx402 system. Configure your webhook endpoint in the dashboard to receive these events.

### Endpoint Configuration
- HTTPS required
- Maximum response time: 10 seconds
- Retry policy: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Signature verification available

    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Configuration

### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Create a secure HTTPS endpoint in your application
2. Register the endpoint in your [gx402 Dashboard](https://gx402.com/dashboard)
3. Select which events to receive
4. Optionally configure signature verification

### Signature Verification

For security, verify webhook signatures:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const verifyWebhookSignature = (payload, signature, secret) => {
  const expectedSignature = 'sha256=' + 
    crypto
      .createHmac('sha256', secret)
      .update(payload, 'utf8')
      .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
};
```

### Response Requirements

Your webhook endpoint should:
- Return a 2xx status code within 10 seconds
- Process events asynchronously when possible
- Implement idempotency (handle duplicate events gracefully)
- Log events for debugging purposes
