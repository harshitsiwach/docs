## Integration Highlights

### Notable Features Used by Community

#### Real-time Synchronization
Many community projects highlight the real-time sync capabilities:

```javascript
// Common pattern in community projects
gx402.subscribe('game-state', (state) => {
  updateGameState(state);
});

await gx402.sync('player-position', {
  playerId: user.id,
  x: player.x,
  y: player.y
});
```

#### Cross-Platform Progression
```javascript
// Popular for progression systems
const savedProgress = await gx402.query('player-progress', {
  where: { userId: currentUser.id }
});
```

#### x402 Processing
```javascript
// Game logic enhancement
const processedEvent = await gx402.processX402Data({
  eventType: 'player-action',
  data: actionData,
  context: gameState
});
```
