## Common Issues and Solutions

### SDK Initialization Problems

**Problem**: SDK fails to initialize
**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key is correct and active
2. Check your network connectivity
3. Ensure proper permissions are set (mobile platforms)
4. Review platform-specific setup requirements

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Authentication fails
**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Check common authentication patterns
gx402.authenticate('user-id', 'valid-token')
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Auth failed:', error.code, error.message);
    // Handle specific error codes
    if (error.code === 'INVALID_TOKEN') {
      // Refresh token logic
    }
  });
```

### Sync Problems

**Problem**: Real-time sync doesn't work
**Solutions**:
- Verify `enableRealtimeSync: true` in configuration
- Check WebSocket connectivity
- Ensure proper authentication
- Review network restrictions

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Step 1: Enable Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable detailed logging
gx402.configure({
  debug: true,
  logLevel: 'verbose'
});
```

### Step 2: Check API Key
```javascript
// Verify your API key is properly formatted
const isValidKey = apiKey && apiKey.length > 10;
if (!isValidKey) {
  console.error('Invalid API key format');
}
```

### Step 3: Test Network Connection
```javascript
// Test basic connectivity
try {
  await gx402.testConnection();
  console.log('Connection OK');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Connection failed:', error);
}
```

### Step 4: Review Platform Requirements
- Check minimum platform versions
- Verify required permissions
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
