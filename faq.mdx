# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about the gx402 SDK, installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

## Getting Started

### What is gx402 SDK?
The gx402 SDK provides developers with comprehensive x402 functionality specifically designed for gaming applications. It enables cross-platform game development with real-time synchronization, data processing, and security features across Unity, Unreal Engine, WebGL, Mobile, Telegram, and Farcaster platforms.

### Who should use gx402 SDK?
The SDK is ideal for game developers who want to:
- Build cross-platform games with shared game state
- Implement real-time multiplayer features
- Leverage x402 functionality in their games  
- Create social gaming experiences across different platforms
- Focus on game development rather than infrastructure

### How much does gx402 cost?
We offer a generous free tier for small projects and indie developers. For production applications and larger teams, we have flexible pricing tiers based on usage. Check our [pricing page](https://gx402.com/pricing) for current plans.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I get an API key?
1. Visit [gx402.com](https://gx402.com) and sign up for an account
2. Create a new project in your dashboard
3. Copy your API key from the project settings
4. Use the key to initialize the SDK in your game

### Do I need different API keys for different platforms?
No, you can use the same API key across all supported platforms for the same project. However, we recommend using separate keys for development vs. production environments.

### How do I install the SDK on my platform?
Each platform has specific installation instructions:
- **Unity**: Use Package Manager with git URL
- **Unreal Engine**: Download and install the plugin
- **WebGL**: Use npm or CDN
- **Mobile**: Use platform package managers (CocoaPods, Gradle)

See our [platform guides](/platforms) for detailed instructions.

## Authentication & Security

### How does authentication work?
The SDK provides multiple authentication methods:
- Simple token-based authentication
- OAuth integration for social platforms
- Custom authentication using your existing system
- Anonymous authentication for guest users

### Is my data secure with gx402?
Yes, we implement multiple layers of security:
- End-to-end encryption for all data
- Secure authentication protocols
- Compliance with industry standards
- Regular security audits

All data transmission is encrypted by default using AES-256 encryption.

### What permissions does the SDK require?
The SDK only requests necessary permissions:
- Network access for synchronization
- Storage access for offline capability (mobile)
- No unnecessary permissions like location or contacts
- Permission requests are always user-facing with clear explanations

## Sync & Networking

### How does real-time synchronization work?
The SDK uses an optimized synchronization protocol that:
- Tracks changes to game state efficiently
- Resolves conflicts automatically using configurable strategies
- Works across all supported platforms
- Handles offline scenarios with automatic sync when reconnected

### Can I control sync frequency?
Yes, you can configure sync settings:
- Set custom sync intervals (default is 1 second)
- Choose optimistic vs. pessimistic sync strategies
- Configure batch sync for better performance
- Disable sync for specific data types when needed

### What happens when players go offline?
- Local changes are queued for sync
- Players can continue playing offline
- Changes are automatically synced when connection is restored
- Conflict resolution handles concurrent changes

## Performance

### How much performance overhead does the SDK add?
The SDK is optimized for gaming performance:
- Minimal CPU overhead during normal operation
- Efficient memory usage with configurable limits
- Network usage optimized for gaming scenarios
- Most operations are asynchronous to prevent blocking

Typical overhead is less than 1% of total game performance.

### Does the SDK work well on mobile devices?
Yes, we have specific optimizations for mobile:
- Reduced network usage to preserve battery
- Efficient data compression
- Offline-first architecture
- Background sync with power management

### How does it handle large amounts of data?
- Automatic data compression
- Smart sync that only transfers changes
- Configurable data limits and batching
- Streaming support for large datasets

## Platform Support

### Which platforms are supported?
Current support includes:
- Unity (all versions 2019.4+)
- Unreal Engine (4.26+ and 5.x)
- WebGL (modern browsers)
- iOS (12.0+)
- Android (API level 21+)
- Telegram mini apps
- Farcaster integrations

### Can I connect different platforms together?
Yes! Cross-platform connectivity is a core feature:
- A player on mobile can play with someone on desktop
- Progression syncs across all platforms
- Multiplayer games work seamlessly between platforms
- All platforms use the same synchronization protocol

### Is there a web-based management interface?
Yes, our dashboard provides:
- Real-time usage and performance metrics
- Player management and analytics
- API key and project configuration
- Event logs and troubleshooting tools

## Troubleshooting

### The SDK isn't initializing properly
Common causes and solutions:
- **Invalid API key**: Verify it's copied correctly and hasn't expired
- **Network issues**: Check connectivity and firewall settings
- **Platform requirements**: Ensure minimum platform versions
- **Configuration errors**: Review initialization parameters

### Sync is not working between clients
- Verify all clients are authenticated
- Check that real-time sync is enabled in configuration
- Confirm all clients are using the same project API key
- Ensure network connectivity between clients

### Getting authentication errors
- Verify user credentials are valid
- Check that authentication tokens haven't expired
- Ensure proper authentication flow is implemented
- Review server time synchronization for time-based tokens

### Performance issues in my game
- Reduce sync frequency if updating too frequently
- Optimize the data being synced (sync only essential data)
- Use batch operations for multiple changes
- Check for memory leaks in your implementation

## Development Best Practices

### How should I structure my game data for sync?
- Keep synced data lightweight
- Separate game logic from sync logic
- Use consistent data schemas across platforms
- Consider using data normalization for complex objects

### What's the best way to handle conflicts?
- Implement custom conflict resolution for important data
- Use the SDK's built-in strategies for simple cases
- Validate data before syncing
- Provide user feedback when conflicts occur

### How do I handle version compatibility?
- The SDK handles most backward compatibility automatically
- Use feature detection for advanced functionality
- Plan for deprecation with version checking
- Test with previous SDK versions during development
