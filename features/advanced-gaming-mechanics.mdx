# Advanced Gaming Mechanics

The gx402 SDK supports advanced gaming mechanics, enabling sophisticated monetization strategies and dynamic in-game economies.

## 3.2.1 Dynamic Pricing

Adjust prices for in-game items and services dynamically based on various factors:

*   **Player skill level (ELO-based)**: Prices can be adjusted based on a player's skill rating, offering personalized pricing.
*   **Supply/demand (limited items)**: Implement dynamic pricing for limited-edition items, where prices fluctuate based on availability and player demand.
*   **Time-of-day (happy hour discounts)**: Offer time-sensitive discounts or price changes to encourage engagement during specific periods.
*   **Bundle composition (cross-promotion)**: Dynamically price bundles of items, potentially offering discounts for cross-promotional packages.

## 3.2.2 Reward Distribution

Implement smart contract-based automated payouts for various in-game scenarios:

*   **Winner-takes-all tournaments**: Automatically distribute the entire prize pool to the single winner of a tournament.
*   **Top N players prize pool split**: Distribute prize pools among the top-performing players based on predefined percentages.
*   **Participation rewards for all entrants**: Provide smaller rewards to all participants in an event, encouraging broader engagement.
*   **Referral bonuses for friend invites**: Automatically reward players for inviting new users to the game.

## 3.2.3 Anti-Cheat Integration

Link payments and in-game rewards to anti-cheat systems to ensure fair play and maintain game integrity:

*   **Fair play detection systems**: Integrate with anti-cheat systems to identify and penalize fraudulent behavior.
*   **Reputation scores**: Incorporate player reputation scores into payment and reward systems.
*   **Ban enforcement (no refunds for cheaters)**: Automatically enforce bans and prevent cheaters from receiving refunds for in-game purchases.
*   **Trusted player verification**: Implement mechanisms to verify trusted players, potentially offering them exclusive benefits or access.
