# Unity Integration

The gx402 SDK provides seamless integration with the Unity game engine, bringing all the power of x402 functionality to your Unity projects.

## Installation

To install the gx402 SDK in your Unity project, follow these steps:

### Using Unity Package Manager

1. Open your Unity project
2. Go to `Window` > `Package Manager`
3. Click the `+` button in the top-left corner
4. Select "Add package from git URL..."
5. Enter the gx402 SDK repository URL: `https://github.com/gx402/unity-sdk.git`
6. Click "Add"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [gx402 Unity SDK releases page](https://github.com/gx402/unity-sdk/releases)
2. Extract the package in your Unity project's `Assets` folder
3. Unity will automatically import the SDK

## Basic Setup

After installation, you need to initialize the SDK in your game:

```csharp
using Gx402;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Initialize the gx402 SDK
        Gx402Manager.Initialize("your-api-key");
        
        // Configure x402 functionality
        Gx402Manager.Configure(new Gx402Config
        {
            EnableRealtimeSync = true,
            LogLevel = Gx402LogLevel.Debug
        });
    }
}
```

## Core Features

### Authentication
```csharp
// Authenticate user
Gx402Manager.Authenticate("user-id", "authentication-token", (success, error) => {
    if (success) {
        Debug.Log("Authentication successful!");
    } else {
        Debug.LogError($"Authentication failed: {error}");
    }
});
```

### x402 Functionality
```csharp
// Use x402 features in your game
var x402Result = Gx402Manager.ProcessX402Data(gameData);
```

## Best Practices

- Initialize the SDK as early as possible in your game
- Always check for network connectivity before making API calls
- Handle authentication errors gracefully
- Use the Unity SDK's built-in logging for debugging
