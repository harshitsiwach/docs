# Unreal Engine Integration

The gx402 SDK provides native integration with Unreal Engine, allowing you to leverage x402 functionality in your Unreal projects with full C++ and Blueprint support.

## Installation

To install the gx402 SDK in your Unreal Engine project, you have two primary options:

### Download from Unreal Marketplace

1.  Open the Unreal Engine Marketplace from within the Unreal Editor or your web browser.
2.  Search for "GX402 Payment SDK".
3.  Follow the instructions to download and add the plugin to your project.

### Clone Source

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to your project's `Plugins` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
3.  Clone the gx402 Unreal SDK repository: `git clone https://github.com/gx402/unreal-sdk.git`
4.  Copy the cloned `gx402-sdk` folder into your project's `Plugins` directory.
5.  Restart the Unreal Editor and enable the plugin in `Edit` > `Plugins`.

## Minimal Implementation Example (Blueprint)

Here's a basic example of how to integrate the gx402 SDK into your Unreal Engine project using Blueprints to handle in-game purchases.

```blueprint
[Begin Play]
    ↓
[Create GX402 Client]
    ↓
    Receiver Address: OxYourAddress
    Network: Base
    ↓
[On Button Click: Buy Sword]
    ↓
[Call: GX402 Purchase (Async)]
    ↓
    Item ID: "legendary_sword"
    Price: 2.50
    Currency: USDC
    ↓
[On Success]  ←  [Grant Item]  ←  [Show Success UI]
[On Failure]  ←  [Show Error UI]
```
