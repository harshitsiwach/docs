# Unreal Engine Integration

The gx402 SDK provides native integration with Unreal Engine, allowing you to leverage x402 functionality in your Unreal projects with full C++ and Blueprint support.

## Installation

### Plugin Installation

1. Download the gx402 Unreal Engine plugin from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gx402/unreal-sdk/releases)
2. Create an `Plugins` folder in your project directory if it doesn't exist
3. Copy the plugin folder to `YourProject/Plugins/gx402-sdk`
4. Restart the Unreal Editor
5. Enable the plugin in Edit > Plugins > Project > gx402 SDK

### C++ Integration

If you prefer to integrate the SDK directly:

1. Add the gx402 library files to your project's `Source` directory
2. Include `gx402-sdk.h` in your module build file
3. Link against the appropriate platform libraries

## Basic Setup

### C++ Example

```cpp
// In your game mode or player controller header file
#include "Gx402SDK.h"

UCLASS()
class YOURGAME_API AYourGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    virtual void StartPlay() override;

private:
    void InitializeGx402();
};

// In the implementation file
void AYourGameMode::StartPlay()
{
    Super::StartPlay();
    InitializeGx402();
}

void AYourGameMode::InitializeGx402()
{
    // Configure the SDK
    FGx402Config Config;
    Config.ApiKey = TEXT("your-api-key");
    Config.bEnableRealtimeSync = true;
    
    // Initialize the SDK
    UGx402Manager::Initialize(Config);
}
```

### Blueprint Integration

1. Create a new Blueprint that extends from GameModeBase
2. In the Event Graph, call "Initialize Gx402 SDK" node during BeginPlay
3. Connect to the success/failure events to handle initialization

## Core Features

### Authentication
```cpp
UGx402Manager::Authenticate("user-id", "auth-token", 
    [](bool bSuccess, const FString& ErrorMessage) {
        if (bSuccess) {
            UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("gx402 Authentication successful"));
        } else {
            UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("gx402 Authentication failed: %s"), *ErrorMessage);
        }
    });
```

### x402 Functionality
```cpp
// Process game data with x402 functionality
FGx402Result Result = UGx402Manager::ProcessX402Data(GameData);
```

## Supported Platforms

The Unreal Engine integration supports all major platforms:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- iOS
- Android
- PlayStation
- Xbox
- Nintendo Switch

## Best Practices

- Initialize the SDK early in your game lifecycle
- Handle platform-specific considerations during deployment
- Use Unreal's blueprint node system for non-programmer integration
- Test thoroughly across all target platforms
- Monitor SDK performance in profiling tools
