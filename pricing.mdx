## Monetization Strategy

Our monetization strategy is designed to be simple, transparent, and aligned with the success of our developers. We offer a flexible pricing model that scales with your game's growth.

### Facilitator Fees

We charge a small percentage of the transaction volume that we process. This fee is calculated based on your monthly payment volume.

*   **Free Tier**: 0-$1K monthly volume -> 2% fee
*   **Startup Tier**: $1K-$10K -> 1.5% fee
*   **Growth Tier**: $10K-$100K -> 1% fee
*   **Enterprise Tier**: $100K+ -> 0.5% fee + custom terms

**Example:**

A game processing $50K in monthly payments would fall into the Growth Tier.

*   **GX402 Fee**: $500 (1% of volume)
*   **Developer Keeps**: $49,500
