## Go-To-Market Strategy

Our go-to-market strategy is designed to build a strong developer community, validate our technology, and rapidly grow our ecosystem.

### Phase 0: Private Beta (Q4 2025)

*   **Objectives**: Validate core SDK functionality, gather developer feedback, and identify integration pain points.
*   **Activities**: Recruit 10 pilot developers (Unity focus), provide dedicated technical support, iterate on the SDK, and build case studies.
*   **Success Metrics**: 8/10 developers successfully integrate, <2 hours average integration time, 95%+ payment success rate on testnet.

### Phase 1: Public Launch (Q1 2026)

*   **Objectives**: Achieve 100 game integrations, establish a brand presence in Web3 gaming, and generate initial revenue.
*   **Activities**: Launch marketing website, publish comprehensive documentation, release on Unity Asset Store and Unreal Marketplace, attend GDC 2026, and launch a developer Discord community.
*   **Marketing Channels**: Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube, technical blogs (Dev.to, Hashnode), and indie game dev forums.

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion (Q2-Q3 2026)

*   **Objectives**: Add Telegram/Mini app support, launch fiat onramp integration, and grow to 500 games.
*   **Activities**: Partner with Coinbase for Smart Wallet integration, integrate Farcaster Frame actions, launch "Build with GX402" grants program, and sponsor gaming hackathons.
*   **Partnerships**: Telegram, Coinbase, Thirdweb, and Unity/Epic.

### Phase 3: Enterprise & Scale (Q4 2026+)

*   **Objectives**: Sign major gaming studios, expand to non-EVM chains (Solana), and launch the GX402 DAO for governance.
*   **Activities**: Direct sales to mid-size studios, custom enterprise contracts, multi-chain infrastructure deployment, and token launch.
