# Hello World with gx402

In this tutorial, you'll create your first application using the gx402 SDK. We'll build a simple game that demonstrates basic x402 functionality.

## What You'll Build

A simple web page with a button that triggers an in-game purchase using the gx402 SDK.

## Prerequisites

*   Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
*   Node.js and npm (for installing the gx402 SDK).
*   Your gx402 API key (optional for this basic example, but good practice).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

First, create a new directory and initialize a project:

```bash
mkdir gx402-purchase-example
cd gx402-purchase-example
npm init -y
npm install @gx402/sdk
```

Create an `index.html` file with a button to trigger the purchase:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>gx402 Purchase Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Buy a Legendary Sword!</h1>
    <button id="buyButton">Buy Legendary Sword (0.50 USDC)</button>
    <p id="status">Click the button to make a purchase.</p>
    
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

Create a `main.js` file and initialize the gx402 SDK:

```javascript
import { GX402Client } from '@gx402/sdk';

const gx402 = new GX402Client({
    receiverAddress: 'OxYourWalletAddress', // Replace with your game's wallet address
    network: 'base',
    // Other configurations like facilitatorUrl can be added here
});

const buyButton = document.getElementById('buyButton');
const statusElement = document.getElementById('status');

statusElement.textContent = 'SDK Initialized. Ready to purchase.';
```

## Step 3: Implement Basic Purchase Functionality

Add an event listener to the buy button to trigger the `gx402.purchase` function:

```javascript
buyButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    statusElement.textContent = 'Processing purchase...';
    try {
        const tx = await gx402.purchase({
            itemId: "legendary_sword",
            price: "0.50", // $0.50 USDC
            currency: "USDC",
            metadata: { userId: "player123", sessionId: "abc" }
        });
        statusElement.textContent = `Purchase successful! Transaction Hash: ${tx.hash}`;
        console.log('Purchase successful:', tx);
    } catch (error) {
        statusElement.textContent = `Purchase failed: ${error.message}`;
        console.error('Purchase failed:', error);
    }
});
```
